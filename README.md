# Read All Literature

This is a mod for the Project Zomboid that adds two options to containers with books. You can either collect all the books that you have not yet acquired in your inventory, or have your character read all the books in the container that they don't know yet, one after the other.

## Features

- Collect all unacquired books in the container to your inventory
- Read all unknown books in the container, one after the other
- Individually collected books are now also included in the collection
- Translations for English and German included
- Code revision and clean layout
- Books are put back after reading

## Credits

- Thanks to tyriell for the idea
- Thanks to PePePePeil and his mod "Has Been Read" for helping to understand the Lua code (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2544353492)

## Known Bugs

- Magazines cause an error in the queue when they are put back. Currently, only talent books are put back due to the area being commented out.

## Future Plans

- Bugfixes
- Option to make all features optional in the server configuration
- Own bookshelf with enough space for all books and magazines
- Swarm Intelligence to collect books in groups and prevent other players from taking books that are already known in the group
- New books for the game. Wishes and suggestions are welcome in the comments.
