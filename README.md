#Read All Literature.

This mod adds two options to containers with books. Firstly, you can collect all the books that you have not yet had in your inventory. On the other hand, the character reads all the books that are in the container and that he does not know yet, one after the other.

Credits:
- A thank you to tyriell who came to me with the idea
- I would also like to thank PePePePeil with his mod "Has Been Read". Through your code I have understood at all what I do with the Lua stuff. (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2544353492)

Features and fixes V1.1:
- Individually collected books are now also included in the collection
- The translations for English and German have been added. If there are other languages that someone would like to have write it to me in the comments
- The code has been revised and got a clean layout
- Books are put back after reading

Known bugs:
- Magazines cause an error in the queue when they are put back. At the moment the area is commented out, therefore only talent books are put back.

Planned functions in the future:
- Bugfixes
- Make all features optional in the server configuration
- Own bookshelf with enough space for all books and magazines
- Swarm Inteligence. So that you can collect books in groups and as soon as a book is known in the group the other players do not take it anymore
- New books for the game. Wishes and suggestions are also welcome in the comments.
